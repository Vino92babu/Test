# Arithmetic Operators
'''
Addition --> "+"
Subtraction --> "-"
Multipl --> "*"
Division --> "/"
Modulus --> %
Expoentiation --> "**"
Floor Division --> "//"
'''
# A = 10
# B = 3
# print(A+B)
# print(A-B)
# print(A*B)
# print(A**B) --> 10*10*10 = 1000
# print(A/B)
# print(A//B)



# Assignment Operators
'''
= --> Assign--> A=5
+= --> Add&Assign --> A+=5 --> A =A+5
-= --> A-=5 --> A = A-5
*=
/=
%=
**=
//=
'''

# Comparision/Relational Operators

# == --> equto too
# != --> not equal to
# > --> Greater than
# < --> Lesser Than
# >= --> Greater then or equal to 
# <= --> Lesser than or equal to 

# A = 10
# B = 3
# print(A==B)
# print(A!=B)
# print(A>B)
# print(A<B)
# print(A<=B)
# print(A>=B)

# Logical Operators
# "And" --> Returns True, Both statement are "true"
# "Or" --> Returns True, any one statement are "true"
# "Not" --> Returns True, when  statement are "false"

# Returns True, Bothe statement are "true"

# Identity Operats

# is --> 
# is not

# A = [1,2,3]
# B = [1,2,3]
# C =  A
# print(A is C)

"Membership Operators"

# in 
# not in

# A = [1,2,3,4]
# print(4 not in A)
